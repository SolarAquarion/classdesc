Pointers
</H2>

<P>
<code>&lt;rant&gt;</code>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM><EM>Pointers are evil!</EM>. Pointers<A NAME="247"></A> are a dangerous
programming construction, and widely abused in the C++ programming
world. They often lead to obscure programming errors, and in
particular to <EM>memory leaks</EM>, which are notoriously hard to
debug. If there is an alternative method that encapsulates pointers,
or avoids their use altogether, then that should be
used. Unfortunately, pointers are vital to programming in C, and many
of the practices are imported into C++.
</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code>

<P>
Whilst the above might be considered a little extreme, it is
worthwhile listing what pointers are used for, and considering what
alternatives there might be. In Classdesc, objects are usually assumed
to have the following properties: default constructable, copyable,
assignable and serialisable. All the simple traditional C data
types except for pointers satisfy these properties. Compound types
(structs and classes) whose members satisy these properties also
satisfy them, with classdesc automagically extending the
serialisability property.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Pass by reference</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In C++, the reference operator <code>&amp;</code> makes
  obsolete the use of pointers for returning values from function
  subroutines, and improves type safety. Of course this use of
  pointers is of no concern for serialisation.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Dynamic Memory</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In C++, we have the <TT>new</TT> operator to return
  an array of objects from the heap. However, one must be careful to
  <TT>delete</TT> the array of objects once finished with, otherwise a
  memory leak may result. In this case, encapsulation can help. If the
  pointer is encapsulated with a class definition, then the <TT>    delete</TT> can be called automatically when the object's destructor
  is called, which happens automatically when an object goes out of
  scope. The simple case of allocating some dynamic memory from the
  heap can be most readily performed using the standard library
  container <code>vector&lt;T&gt;</code>.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Strings</STRONG></DT>
<DD><TT>char *</TT> variables can be replaced by the standard
  library <TT>string</TT> type.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Dynamic references</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Dynamic references are used a lot to
  represent graph structures, or to provide access to objects declared
  outside the current scope. For some purposes, C++'s static reference
  type (<code>T&amp;</code>) is suitable, but is limited to being initialised
  only at object construction time. Also, any reference loops will
  cause serialisation to enter an infinite loop and crash. C++ offers
  more possibilities in the form of ``smart pointers'', that guarantee
  destruction of the referenced object once the reference object goes
  out of scope. The standard C++ library provides <code>auto_ptr</code>, but
  this is noncopyable, pretty much defeating the purpose of smart
  pointers. The Boost library (http://www.boost.org) provides several
  different sharable smart pointers, that can be used. Classdesc
  provides its own concept, <TT>ref</TT> (see &#167;<A HREF="node14.html#ref">2.3</A>) that
  is a type of dynamic reference.  It should be noted that linked
  lists can be handled easily with standard library containers.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Legacy APIs</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Many C-based legacy APIs use pointers for pass by
  reference functionality, strings, or for anonymous references (to
  avoid publishing the full specification of an object). These APIs
  can be easily encapsulated to ensure any allocated pointers are
  appropriately cleaned up.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Global references</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An object that needs to be destroyed before
  main() exits, yet needs to be referred to globally throughout the
  program cannot be implemented as a global object (which is destroyed
  after the program exits). Instead, it has to either be a global
  pointer, which is initialised when the object is created, or the
  entire program must be implemented as a method of an object which is
  created in main().
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Runtime polymorphism</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Since the actual datatype might vary,
  only references to the object can be handled. Traditional
  pointer-based polymorphic systems are not copyable, assignable nor
  serialisable, as copying a point to an allocated object invariably
  leads to double free() errors (in the case of destructors cleaning
  up pointers) or to memory leaks (in the case destructors don't do
  anything). Traditionally, copying is performed by means of a
  <code>clone()</code> virtual method, which is also how this is done in
  Java. EcoLab provides an  PolyBase (see
    &#167;<A HREF="node18.html#polymorphism">2.7</A>) base class in <code>Poly.h</code> which
  provides an interface for cloning, and interfaces for serialisation
  can be found in the <code>PolyPack</code>, <code>PolyXML</code> and
  <code>PolyJson</code> headers and a simple
  runtime type identification system. To create a reference, the
  smart, modern way to do this is via the <code>shared_ptr</code> smart
  pointer class, which is found in the TR1 library of your compiler,
  or in Boost if your compiler does not do TR1.
